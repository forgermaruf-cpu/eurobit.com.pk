            Eurobit was founded to end Pakistan's reliance on imported
            waterproofing materials. Every product in our catalogue is
            manufactured at our own facility in Lahore rather than imported —
            engineered specifically for the country's monsoon, saim, and heat.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            We are registered with the Pakistan Engineering Council, Military
            Engineer Services, and the Securities and Exchange Commission of
            Pakistan.
